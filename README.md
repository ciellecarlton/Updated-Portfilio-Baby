# Updated-Portfolio-Baby
This is the second verson of my portfolio.

This page includes HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap:

I wanted to make my portfolio more aesthetically pleasing and update the portfolio.html page. I added my first project (Safe Space) and some of the projects that I felt I didnt pretty well on. 

I got rid of the navigation bar and added small links to other pages.

I added a different header and edited my bio. 

Both the home page and portfolio page utilize bootstrap features and grid system. 

I added links to my social media accounts within the footer of each page.
